            <br>
            <br>
        <li>I am Illiyas from Chennai, currently studying at Vel Tech Multi Tech Dr. Rangarajan Dr. Sakunthala Engineering College in Avadi. 
            I am pursuing a BE in Electrical and Communication Engineering. Despite my engineering background, I have also delved into various programming languages such as Python, C, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
            My primary interest lies in web development, and I am excited to share that I have embarked on my first project: creating my portfolio using HTML. 
            This endeavor marks the beginning of my journey into the realm of web development, where I aim to hone my skills and contribute meaningfully to the digital landscape.</li>
