# portfolio
Crafting my first web development portfolio using only HTML and CSS is a great way to hone your skills. It allows me to focus on the fundamentals of front-end development while showcasing my creativity and design abilities. Keep refining my portfolio, and don't hesitate to experiment with different layouts and styles to truly make it my own.
